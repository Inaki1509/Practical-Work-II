## 1. Introduction
This document presents a solution for a number calculator that is able to make different conversions between different numerical bases and systems. In particular, it is able to convert numbers between decimal to binary, hexadecimal, octal, and Binary Two Complement, and vice versa. It does this by using the .Net Maui architecture and a View Model View Model to produce both a navigable user interface as well as the code behind this interface. This solution was made using Visual Studio Code and the Net MAUI extension as well as an App Shell infrastructure.
As this is the Extraordinary call, this solution also presents a new functionality in which, for the operations that require it, DecimalToBinary and DecimalToTwosComplement, the program asks the user for the number of bits to represent the number; and then determines whether this value is correct for representing the input in the desired conversion. Then the calculator works normally. 

## 2. Description
The specific behavior behind this solution goes as follows. The Main page was renamed as LogIn page, and is the beginning of the project where compilation starts. Every page has an image of the UFV logo at the top which serves as a redirect to the LogIn page. From the interface page (xaml), there are two entries in which the user must enter his username and password. In the code behind page (xaml.cs) the behavior of the entries is applied, and the system searches for those particular username and password in a database which is a csv file (User_Info.csv) in the ExtraFiles folder. This logic applies to every single page of the solution. The LogIn page also has two texts that redirect the user to either a PasswordRecovery page where he can enter a valid email (assured with the csv file) to recover his password; and a SignUp page where he can Sign Up with a username, email, password (and confirmation) as well as a checkbox to accept the Privacy Policy. 
This redirection is done using the App Shell, and because of this, the methods that contain them must be declared as async and contain the await keyword (with which the system knows when to redirect) and nameof (to know where to redirect). This is also used for displaying alerts across every page, which are defined in the code behind page. In the SignUp code behind page, the system makes sure that the email entered is valid and that the password has at least 8 characters, one uppercase, one lowercase, one number and a special character, as well as the logic that assures that the privacy policy checkbox is marked and that the username and password are different. After this, it uploads the username and password, as well as a placeholder for the number of operations, to the same csv file used in LogIn. After redirecting to LogIn, the user can know log in into the Conversor itself.
In here, the user can enter numbers and letters from A-F (for hexadecimal to decimal) to introduce what is going to be converted. This is done by using the same actuator for every button, but then defining a different text for each one, and then adding this text to the entry. In the case of the minus, the program makes sure that the digit begins with a minus, because it wouldn’t be valid if it does not; and for the AC, the program simply clears the entry using string. Clear. After this, the user selects the desired conversion and I decided for simplicity to create a different event actuator for each conversion.  The Conversor page initializes both a Conversor and an Operation List. 
Then, for each of the actuators, the cs file defines an input variable as the text of the entry, and then an output in which it calls the PerformConversion Method of the Converter class but with a different option in every actuator to reach every conversion and using a try catch in order to identify errors in the format of the input. PerformConversion then validates the input in each case, using the validate method (which is overridden for every conversion using a different method). If an error is found, then it is catched by the validate method and passed as a Format Exception. The ConverterPage then proceeds to display an alert for this exception using the message provided, but also leaves another catch to identify other potential errors. Finally, if the input was in the correct format, the conversion is performed and the resulting output is redirected at the entry. Then, even if an error was identified, the resulting operation is added to the operation List using the AddOperations method and to the csv file using the SaveOperations method using a StreamWritter (both methods defined in Operations)
Finally, at the top there are three buttons, one to redirect the user to the operations page, one to Logout and one to Exit. In the operations page, there is a StremReader that reads and displays all the information of the csv file, including the Username, Password and the Operations performed.
For this delivery of the project, I noticed that my operations Page didn’t work as expected as the number of Operations was not correctly updated. Because of this, I decided to change the functionality behind how the active user is passed through the pages, as a Query. By doing this I ensured that the value was correctly updated when navigating to a new page. However, this gave many problems, as it constantly updated late, and because of this I used an overwritten OnNavigatedTo method, particularly for the ShowOperations method in the operations page. This was undoubtedly the most difficult part of this practice, as I constantly received many errors and had to find new ways to solve them
To achieve the new functionality, I used the logic that was already done in Activity #7 which recognize weather a conversion is "bit-sensitive", and I applied it to the ConverterPage, in the DecimalToBinary and DecimalToTwosComplement conversions. I also had to adapt the AddOperations method to include a new nullable field for the number of bits, that is null by defect but takes the value of the bits used for these two conversions. 

The class diagram that describes the behavior of the solution is located at the ExtraFiles folder

## 3. Development Problems
During development, one of the most challenging parts was managing all of the alerts of the system. I did a lot of research to manage the conclusion that the method in which the alert is called must be async, which stands for asynchronous and causes the method itself to run normally until it reaches the await keyword, after which it is suspended until a task is completed, in this case accepting the alert with the keyword OK.
Another important challenge was managing to apply all of the code behind the logic of the Passwords and email requirements in order to prove if they have the correct format. I ended up using a Regex which is a class that stands for Regular Expression. Using the .IsMatch argument, it checks weather the email or password provided matches a description provided as a pattern. This pattern is constructed using special characters such as @^ which in term create the desired pattern.
Managing all the different StreamWriters and StreamReaders proved to be very challenging, in particular considering all of the try and catches and exceptions that needed to be considered. Particularly, it was very difficult to manage each conversion to print the operation in the csv file, and then reading this file again for the OperationsPage. The code behind the ConversorPage conversions ended up being way more redundant and complicated than I expected, but I couldn’t figure out a way to simplify it.
During this delivery, the most important challenge was passing the currentUser as a Query through the different pages, and ensuring that the value was properly updated. It was also challenging to Show the updated Operation Count in the OperationsPage, as there were many problems in which it constantly disappeared, didn’t update or stayed at 0. To solve this, I decided to account for every possible scenario when reading the user file to account for potential errors when reading the different lines of the file, and used File.WriteAllLines method, which I had never used before, to update the value. In regards to the bit logic, I simply adapted what was already done to the Maui environment, so it did not give me to many problems. However, it was difficult to show the number of bits that the operations required, and to solve this I created the nullable and by defect null parameter of bits in AddOperations.
Similar to the IncrementOperations method, the ChangePassword method also used a line split and join in order to update the password of the user if and only if he introduced the username and email correctly. The first time you do this, the program works fine, but the second one, there was a small error which I was only able to solve after researching for a long time and a lot of trial and error.

## 4. Conclusions
During the development of this practice, I learned how to create a Graphical User Interface with controllers, pages, layouts and actuators, using .Net Maui and the App Shell Architecture. Moreover, I learned how to implement a code solution that uses the terminal in a graphical interface. I learned how to create a Log In and Sign Up system and everything it implies, as well as how to control the user’s inputs for a password and email using RegEx. I know understand the entire process behind a log in system.
I also developed my knowledge about C# development as a whole, in terms of Composition, Inheritance and Polymorphism. Lastly, my solution is probably not the most efficient in terms of use and allocation of resources, particularly in certain aspects such as when calling the PerformConversion method. However, it manages to create a coherent graphical user interface with working logic and navigation. For future projects, I will dedicate more time into designing the execution of code before implementing it, to avoid this redundancy.
During this delivery, I learned to use Query to pass arguments between different pages in the Maui environment. I improved my skills with the StreamWritter and StremReader functionalities by learning new methods like File.WriteAllLines. Lastly, for future reference I am going to research and test why the mistake occured when changing the paswword more than once in order to learn from this situation. In conclusion, I improved my skills in the Maui and in particular the C# environment as a whole, discovering new ways to create functions, control errors and even new functionalities behind simple things like splitting a line or parsing a value, and their great usefulness when coding in these environments.
